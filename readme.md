# Project Overview

This project involves setting up a full-stack application with the following components:

1. **Frontend**: Developed using modern web technologies to provide a user-friendly interface.
2. **Backend**: Built with a Node.js and Express-based server to handle requests and connect to the database.
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL database initialized using Vercel's provided hosting for storage.

---

### Current State of the Project

- The **frontend** and **backend** have been successfully set up and integrated.
- The **PostgreSQL database** has been initialized to store user information and other required data.

---

### Issues Encountered

While the initial setup of the project components has been completed, the following issue is being faced:

- The **registration and login functionality** is not working as expected.  
- Users cannot register successfully, which is preventing proper testing of authentication and authorization features.

---

### Next Steps

Efforts are currently focused on debugging and resolving the issue with user registration and login functionality. The problem might involve:
- Backend API endpoints for authentication.
- Database interaction logic for storing and validating user credentials.
- Frontend-to-backend integration during the registration and login process.

Further investigation and testing are ongoing to identify and address the root cause of the issue.
